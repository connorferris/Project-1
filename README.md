Background - The Department of Information Technologies recently received a grant to increase the number of women and other under-represented groups in its computing programs from the National Center for Women and Information Technology (NCWIT).  As part of this effort, the department administers surveys every Fall in its entry-level computing classes and its computer literacy courses (for non-majors).
Goal - The goal of the survey is to find out how best to recruit women and other under-represented groups.

What is in the Repository - In the repository you will find the survey data collect, the excel analysis, and word documents to better explain what was learned in the analysis
